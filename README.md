# Alura Challenge Data Science - 2022 Edition

The challenge comprises in four weekly activities simulating a telecom company - Alura Voz - that desires to reduce its clients' churn rate through a data-driven decision process. The activities aim to gather the clients' data, avaiable in an API in JSON format, treat these data, process them, analise them and finally, based on them, develop a predictive model using machine learning to classify whose are keener to unsubscribe the company's services and to indicate which actions can be implemented lest this happen.

The first week is dedicated to the data cleansing. More of the process will be updated here as far as the work evolves.
